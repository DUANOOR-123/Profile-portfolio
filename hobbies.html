        <h1>SOMETHING ABOUT MY HOBBIES</h1>
        <p>There has never been a year in my life when I could stay consistently committed to one thing. My hobbies tend to
            change
            from day to day. Sometimes, I find myself spending endless hours immersed in developing new projects and
            brainstorming
            fresh ideas. Other times, I crave the simplicity of rest—just lying in bed, enjoying the comfort of a cozy
            environment.
            There are also moments when I embrace my "girl era," where I find joy in cleaning, cooking, and organizing. My
            days
            unfold in a way that I believe is planned by ALLAH. I don’t often make plans unless there’s a deadline to meet.
            In
            short, I’m a bit moody, and as I always say, I do what I love.
